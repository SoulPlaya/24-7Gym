    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
        24/7 Fit was founded in 2013 with a simple mission: to create a welcoming, 
        inclusive fitness community where everyone can achieve their health goals. What started 
        as a small neighborhood gym has grown into a premier fitness facility serving thousands 
        of members.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
        We believe that fitness is not just about physical transformation, but about building 
        confidence, discipline, and a healthier lifestyle. Our dedicated team of trainers and 
        staff are committed to providing the support, equipment, and environment you need to succeed.
